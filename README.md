# MInDes_release
A repository for some ongoing or completed work developed based on the MInDes code package (https://github.com/hq5088028/MInDes).

Each version contains the executable file for linux systems (**MInDes**) and the executable file for 64-bit Windows systems (**MInDes.exe**). Please double-click directly for the use of **MInDes.exe** in WINDOWS SYSTEM or refer to the following steps to use the execution file **MInDes** in LINUX SYSTEM:  
**1. Check the execution file MInDes:**  
./MInDes  
**2. Importing input file (.mindes):**  
./MInDes infile/1_nucleation/ellipse.mindes  
**3. Find the output files (same path as input file):**  
cd infile/1_nucleation/ellipse/

**Note 1: Please follow the input file (.mindes) in the 0_basic_infile folder to learn the function of MInDes step by step.**

**Note 2: The simulation consumes memory and occupies the processor, please pay attention to the consumption of computing resources in real time to avoid potential problems !!!**

**Have fun !**
